## Week 10 lab report 5
1. I used vimdiff on the results.txt files that I created for the cloned Markdown parser and my group Markdown parser. I did bash script.sh > results.txt for both directories. 
2. Different results shown here: (test 170 and test 174)



Links to different tests:


[Test 170 markdown file](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/170.md)


[Test 170 html](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/170.html.test)


[Test 174 markdown file](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/174.md)


[Test 174 html](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/174.html.test)



The given Markdown Parser is on the left, and my group MarkdownParser on the right.

The issue for both can be that our implementation of Markdown Parse only looks for [] [() and if those donâ€™t exist, it skips it. 
This can be seen here:

If the open bracket is greater than the ending brackets or parentheses, the return is broken. This correlates to why the results are an empty array "[]". 
A way to resolve this bug is to create a condition that doesn't break the code if the parentheses or brackets are out of order and to keep track of the position of parentheiss. This allows us to know when the link ends and doesn't get confused with the parentheses.
